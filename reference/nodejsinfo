Info

after installing the dependencies as the nodemon and the uuid ,
if we change the system or in any case the dependencies are not isntalled we can
just type NPM INSTALL so that it acn be installed again.

If we want the server to change dynamically
then what we can do is run it with nodemon by changing it in scripts
start as node index and dev as nodemon index
