### Hibernate
- converts the pojo's into tables and columns and vice versa.
- mapping annotations. one-to-one, one-to-many.. 
- in hibernate we would use hql (for fetching details from database)

### JPA - standard - all orm's follow jpa.
- pros and cons of it own. standardization vs performance, over abstraction leading to loss in highly detailed control over declaring certain parameters. 
- jpql - query language of jpa.
